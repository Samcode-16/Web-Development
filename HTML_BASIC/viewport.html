HTML Viewport meta tag for Responsive Web Design

comments
A Browser's viewport is the area of the web page in which the content is visible to the user. The viewport does not have the same size, it varies with the variation in screen size of the devices on which the website is visible. For a laptop, the viewport has a larger size as compared to a smartphone or tablet.

Note: When a page is not made responsive for smaller viewports it looks bad or even breaks on a smaller screen. To fix this problem introduce a responsive tag to control the viewport. This tag was first introduced by Apple Inc. for Safari iOS.

Syntax
<meta name="viewport" content= "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
The ' width=device-width ' in meta tag sets the width of the page to follow the screen width of the device, which will vary depending on the device.
The ' initial-scale=1.0 ' in meta tag sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
Attributes
A Responsive tag has the following attributes:

Attribute Values

Description

width

Width of the virtual viewport of the device.

height

Height of the virtual viewport of the device.

initial-scale

Zoom level when the page is first visited.

minimum-scale

Minimum zoom level to which a user can zoom the page.

maximum-scale

Maximum zoom level to which a user can zoom the page.

user-scalable

Flag which allows the device to zoom in or out.(value= yes/no).

Example: The laptop screen is wider without the viewport meta tag.



Example: The screen is responsive with the viewport meta tag .On smartphones the page is adjusted due to narrower screen

This is the common setting of viewport used in various mobile-optimized websites. The width property governs the size of the viewport. It is possible to set it to a specific value ("width=600") in terms of CSS pixels. Here it is set to a special value("width= device-width") which is the width of the device in terms of CSS pixels at a scale of 100%. The initial-scale property governs the zoom level when the page is loaded for the first time.

Example: In this example we will see the implementation of metag tag with an example by making it responsive.
